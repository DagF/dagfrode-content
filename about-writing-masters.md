# About Writing masters

This is a summary / set of notes to be used as reference based on guidelines I revived from my supervisor and other resources shared with me.

__ NB! These are my understanding. I highly recommend reading the resources linked for a better understanding as I might interpret or simplify __

## Ethics

Unethical conducts include:

* Plagiarism, presenting someone else's work as your own.
* Unfair/unacknowledged assistance, not acknowledging work others does for you or having a major part of your project
* Multiple submission / dishonest reuse of own material, submitting the same work for multiple evaluations or part of works.
* Fabrication, creating the wanted results to support hypothesis.
* Unauthorized collection and disclosure, handling sensitive or confidential data in carelessly.
* Research with harmful effects, the work or the method can result in harm people, property, or people.
